\section*{For Loop Review}
Write a program that calculates and displays values for y when \textbf{y = xz / (x - z)}:

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item x ranging between 1 and 5
	\item z ranging between 2 and 6
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hello}
Write, compile, and test a program that repeatedly prints out "Hello World" until the user enters 'q'
\begin{enumerate}
	\item use a while loop.
	\item use a do-while loop. What were the differences?
\end{enumerate}
 What were the differences?

\section*{Random Number Guessing Game}
Write a program that generates a random number between 0 and 100 and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display \textbf{"Too high, try again."}. If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display \textbf{"Too low, try again."} The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. Use the following code as a template:
\begin{lstlisting}{c++}
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> //srand, rand, NULL
#include <ctime> //time

using namespace std;
int main(){
	const int MAXNUM = 100;

	/* initialize random seed: */
	srand (time(NULL));

	/* generate random number between 0 and MAXNUM */
	int rnumber = rand() % MAXNUM;

	//implement the guessing game here
	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
