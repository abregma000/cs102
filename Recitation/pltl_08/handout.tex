\title{CS102: Week 7}

\maketitle

\section*{Display}
Write a program to display the contents of a file. Your program should:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ask the user for the name of a file and display an error if it doesn't exist.
	\item display the contents of that file and display an error it it is empty.
	\item close the file
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Create}
Write a program that saves user input to a file. Your program should:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ask the user for the name of a file and create the file if it doesn't exist
	\item ask the user for a number
	\item write that number to the file
	\item repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user enters -1
	\item close the file
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Copy}
Write a program to copy the contents of a source file to a destination file. Your program should:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ask the user for the name of the source file and display and error if it doesn't exist
	\item ask the user for the name of the destination file and create it if it doesn't exist
	\item copy the contents from the source file to the destination file
	\item close both files
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Save}
Modify the program in \textbf{Create} such that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item read the numbers into an array (stop at -1 or when you've read in 100 numbers)
	\item ask the user if they'd like to save the numbers
	\item if the user says yes, ask for a file to save to
	\item check for the savefile and create it if it doesn't exist
	\item write the numbers to the file
	\item close the file
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Tabulate}
Write a program to read in a list of numbers, compute their sum, and save the sum out. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ask the user for the name of the source file and display and error if it doesn't exist
		\item read the numbers from the file into an array (stop at -1 or when you've read in 100 numbers)
		\item compute the sum of the numbers
		\item ask the user if they'd like to save the sum
		\item if the user says yes, ask for a destination file to save to
		\item check for the savefile and create it if it doesn't exist
		\item write "The sum of the files is:" and the sum to the savefile
		\item close both files
	\end{enumerate}
	\item modify 1 so that the sum is written to the input file.
\end{enumerate}
